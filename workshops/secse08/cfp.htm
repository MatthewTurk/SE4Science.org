<h2 align="center"><u>Call for Papers</u> (<a href="cfp.txt">txt</a>, <a href="cfp.pdf">pdf</a>)</h2><br>
We encourage submission of position papers or statements of interest from members
of the software engineering or computational science and engineering communities.<br> 

Position papers of at most eight pages will be solicited to address issues including but not limited to:
<ul>
		<li>Case studies of software development processes (workflows) used in CS&E applications.
		<li>Measures of software development productivity appropriate to CS&E applications.
		<li>Activity and Purpose-based benchmarks for evaluating existing or proposed CS&E
        architectures
	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for CS&E applications.
	<li>The design of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools,
      languages, and processes used in CS&E application development and how they might be
  		improved.
</ul>

The organizing committee hopes for participation from a broad range of stakeholders 
from across the software engineering, computational science/engeering, and grid
computing communities. Accepted position papers will be posted on this website.<br><br>

This Call for Papers is also available as: (<a href="cfp.pdf">pdf version</a>, <a href="cfp.txt">txt version</a>)<br><br><br>

<h2 align="center">Submission Instructions</h2>
We encourage submission of position papers or statements of interest from members 
of the software engineering or computational science and engineering communities. 
Please note that CS&E applications are not always written for supercomputer implementation; 
we are equally interested in the context where software is developed on other hardware platforms. 
Position papers of at most eight pages are solicited to address issues including but not limited to:

<ul>
		<li>Case studies of software development processes (workflows) used in CS&E applications.
		<li>Measures of software development productivity appropriate to CS&E applications.
		<li>Activity and Purpose-based benchmarks for evaluating existing or proposed CS&E  architectures
		<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for CS&E applications.
		<li>The design of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes used in CS&E application development and how they might be improved.
</ul>
The organizing committee hopes for participation from a broad range of stakeholders from 
across the software engineering, computational science/engineering, and grid computing 
communities. Accepted position papers will be posted on the workshop website.

Please observe the following:
<ol>
		<li>Position papers should be at most 8 pages.  
		<li>Format your paper according to the <a href="http://icse08.upb.de//calls/fsguidelines.html">ICSE 2008 technical paper guidelines</a>  
		<li>Submit your paper in PDF format to <a href="mailto:SECSE08@cse.msstate.edu">SECSE08@cse.msstate.edu</a>  
		<li>Deadline for submission: February 24, 2008.
		<li>Submission notification: March 21, 2008.
