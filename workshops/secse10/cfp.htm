<h2 align="center"><u>Call for Papers</u> (<a href="cfp.pdf">pdf</a>)</h2><br>

We encourage submission of papers from members of the Software Engineering and 
the CSE 
communities. Papers of at most ten pages are solicited to address issues including but not limited to:
<ul>
	<li>Case studies of software development processes used in CSE applications.</li>
	<li>Measures of software development productivity appropriate to CSE applications.</li>
	<li>Lessons learned from the development of CSE applications.</li>
	<li>Software engineering metrics and tool support for CSE applications.</li>
	<li>The use of empirical studies to better understand the environment, tools, languages, and processes 
	    used in CSE application development and how they might be improved.</li>
</ul>

In order to increase participation, we will also accept shorter (~3-4 page) position papers. These papers 
will not be included in the proceedings, but will be made available to workshop participants prior to the 
workshop. Position papers should focus on similar topics as the full papers. For a position paper, please 
include POSITION PAPER in the title.<br><br>

The organizing committee hopes for participation from a broad range of stakeholders from across the software engineering, 
computational science/engineering, and grid computing communities. We especially encourage members of the CSE application 
community to submit practical experience papers. Papers on related topics are also welcome. Please contact the organizers 
with any questions about the relevance of particular topics. Accepted position papers will appear in the 
ICCS proceedings published by Elsevier in their new
<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/719435/description#description">
Procedia Computer Sciences </a>series.<br><br>

This call for papers is also available in <a href="cfp.pdf">PDF</a> format.<br><br>
