### Description 
Despite the importance and usefulness of software in the scientific literature, the methods for making such software visible are still unclear. In addition to formal citations, authors use less formal approaches, such: web page URLs in footnotes, parenthetical notes akin to those used for purchased scientific consumables, and simple mentions in the paper text (with no formal citation). This paper describes how authors currently make software visible in the biology literature and discusses the extent to which this visibility contributes to achieving the normative ideals of scientific practice. Specifically, the authors performed a content analysis of a random sample of 90 Biology journal articles to develop a reliable scheme for identifying mentions of software. They also analyzed how well these mentions achieve the goal of providing a systematic motivation for improving the visibility of software in scientific literature.
