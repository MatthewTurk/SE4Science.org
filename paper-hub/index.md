### [Bridging the Chasm: A Survey of Software Engineering Practice in Scientific Programming](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3084225)
* **Author** - Tim Storer, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom
* **Published in** - Journal, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) - Volume 50 Issue 4, November 2017
### Description <br>
Nowadays, the use of the software is spreading widely in every aspect of scientific research. Different software applications are used to gather, manage, process, synthesise, analyse, or present enormous quantities of data. But it needs a very large, long-lived, and complex effort to develop associated software. However, several researchers found that there is a gap between software engineering and scientific programming. This gap can be a serious risk in producing reliable and trustworthy scientific results. Regarding this, Storer et al. reviews the literature that addresses the gap to explore the best combination of software engineering and scientific research practice need to accommodate the use of software in science.
