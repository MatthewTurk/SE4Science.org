### Description 
The scientific software simulates the physical world, interacts with the scientific reputation economy, and especially the publication system. Therefore, a scientific software ecosystem is necessary to measure the scientific value of software and to guide its production and use. The scientific software ecosystem comes from the way that different pieces of software are brought together and recombined into workflows and assemblies. This paper examines the information needs of different roles in the scientific software ecosystem, abstracts a framework by which to categorize different types of measures and their relationships. Finally, presents policy recommendations designed to improve insight into the scientific software ecosystem, make it more understandable, and thereby contribute to the progress of science.

### [Software in the scientific literature: Problems with seeing, finding, and using software mentioned in the biology literature](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23538)
* **Author** - James Howison, Julia Bullard
* **Published in** - Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (JASIST), Article first published online: 13 May 2015
### Description 
Despite being very important the visibility and usefulness of software in the scientific domain are still in question.  In addition to formal citations in the bibliography, Software is visible in less-formal ways, such as footnoted URLs to web pages maintained by software projects, parenthetical notes akin to those used for purchased scientific consumables, and simply discussed in the text in passing. This paper presents how software is currently visible in the literature and the extent to which this visibility contributes to achieving the normative ideals of scientific practice. To be specific, the authors undertook a content analysis of a random sample of 90 journal articles from Biology and developed a reliable content analytic scheme to identify mentions of software in the literature and to understand how well these mentions achieve desirable function to provide a systematic motivation in improving the systems of visibility for software in scientific literature.

### [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)

### Description 
Scientist developers typically spend 30% or more of their time to develop software. However, almost all of them are self-taught. Therefore they lack manifestation of many basic
software development practices such as using version control and issue trackers, writing maintainable code, and task automation. This paper describes a set of practices that have proven effective in many research setting and are easy to adopt. The authors recommend these practices based on their own experience in building scientific software, reports from many others groups, and software development in general.

### [Testing scientific software: A systematic literature review](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2658307)
* **Author** - Upulee Kanewala, James M. Bieman
* **Published in** - Journal, Information and Software Technology, Volume 56 Issue 10, October-2014, Pages 1219-1232
### Description 
Software faults in the scientific context are more rigorousas scientific software is used in the mission-critical situation, decision making, and computation of evidence for research publications. Even, it caused scientists to retract publications due to errors in scientific software. So, proper testing is very essential in scientific software. Kanewala et al. presents specific challenges, potential solutions, and unsolved problems faced while testing scientific software.

### [Bridging the Chasm: A Survey of Software Engineering Practice in Scientific Programming](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3084225)
* **Author** - Tim Storer, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom
* **Published in** - Journal, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR) - Volume 50 Issue 4, November 2017, Article No. 47
### Description 
Nowadays, the use of the software is spreading widely in every aspect of scientific research. Different software applications are used to gather, manage, process, synthesise, analyse, or present enormous quantities of data. But it needs a very large, long-lived, and complex effort to develop associated software. However, several researchers found that there is a gap between software engineering and scientific programming. This gap can be a serious risk in producing reliable and trustworthy scientific results. Regarding this, Storer et al. reviews the literature that addresses the gap to explore the best combination of software engineering and scientific research practice need to accommodate the use of software in science.
